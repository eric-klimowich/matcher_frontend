# Kitty Kard Matching


## Project Summary

Kitty Kard Matching is a game for fans of cats and the old card game Memory. Users enter their name and then click on cards to "flip" them, revealing pictures of cats. Users try to complete matches as quickly as possible. A timer begins at the start of the game and stops upon completion of the final match. The user's time is their final score and is then displayed among the best times.
